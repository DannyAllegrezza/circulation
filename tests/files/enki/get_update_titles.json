Private Percy Toplis, a survivor of the Battle of Loos, had deserted from the Army Medical Corps before re-enlisting and he was accused as the ringleader of the mutiny. By this time he was back in England where he was living in disguise and was the most wanted man in England (suspected of murder and fraud) before being killed by a policeman in 1920. Drawing on extensive interviews with survivors of the mutiny as well as with friends and relatives of Percy Toplis, this updated edition includes a new introduction and epilogue that expand on newly discovered information about the events of the mutiny and the government's response to it. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Souvenir Press,","dateSaved":"1504498498","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71103","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71103&isn=9780285643253&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71103&isn=9780285643253&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71103&isn=9780285643253&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780285643253","title":"It Gets Easier","author":"Egan, Tracey.","subject":["HEALTH FITNESS Pregnancy Childbirth","FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS Life Stages Infants Toddlers","Childbirth","Pregnancy","Toddlers","Infants"],"topic":["Childbirth.","Infants.","Pregnancy.","Toddlers.","FAMILY & RELATIONSHIPS \/ Life Stages \/ Infants & Toddlers","HEALTH & FITNESS \/ Pregnancy & Childbirth"],"genre":[],"description":"Nothing prepares a mother for the moment when they leave the security of the hospital and arrive home responsible for the care of not one, but two newborn babies.

Though these seemed like small amendments, they were an impetus for real change: from terra nullius to land rights, and from assimilation to self-determination. Nearly 50 years later, there is a groundswell of support for our Indigenous heritage to be formally recognized in the Constitution. With the prospect of a new referendum in the near future, Frank Brennan considers how far Australians have come-and yet how much work lies ahead. He looks through the prism of history to examine what we can learn from our successes and failures since 1967, from the efforts of the Council of Aboriginal Affairs to the Gove land rights case and the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. He also assesses the way forward: how the upcoming referendum might provide fresh momentum for governments and Indigenous Australians to negotiate better outcomes. Written by one of the most respected commentators on legal and human rights issues, this book makes a vital contribution to the understanding of Indigenous affairs. It will generate crucial debate on how Australians should acknowledge the history that for too long has gone unrecognized. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"University of Queensland Press,","dateSaved":"1504498500","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71141","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71141&isn=9780702254598&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71141&isn=9780702254598&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71141&isn=9780702254598&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780702254598","title":"Time for Peace","author":"Reychler, Luc.","subject":["POLITICAL SCIENCE Peace","International relations","Peace","POLITICAL SCIENCE International Relations General"],"topic":["International relations.","Peace.","POLITICAL SCIENCE \/ International Relations \/ General","POLITICAL SCIENCE \/ Peace"],"genre":[],"description":"For building sustainable peace and security, the time is always now. Violence in our world extends beyond armed conflicts: it exists in our social and economic structures, not to mention in our destruction of the environment.

Using examples such as Hurricane Katrina and regime change in Libya, Reychler shows how time is misused in conflicts - be it the failure to anticipate a disaster, or the manipulation of time to create a false sense of urgency. Ultimately, he proposes a more adaptive attitude to time, so that we can be proactive rather than reactive in our efforts at sustainable development and conflict resolution. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"University of Queensland Press,","dateSaved":"1504498500","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71142","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71142&isn=9780702254628&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71142&isn=9780702254628&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71142&isn=9780702254628&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780702254628","title":"Ransacking Paris","author":"Miller, Patti.","subject":["Authors -- Biography","Authors","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Personal Memoirs","Autobiographies","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Literary"],"topic":["Authors","Autobiographies.","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Literary","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Personal Memoirs"],"genre":[],"description":"When Patti Miller arrives in Paris to write for a year, the world glows \"as if the light that comes after the sun has gone down has spilled gold on everything.\" But wasn't that just romantic illusion?

On the western half of the island of New Guinea, hidden from the world, in a place occupied by the Indonesian military since 1963, continues a remarkable nonviolent struggle for national liberation. In Merdeka and the Morning Star, academic Jason MacLeod gives an insider's view of the trajectory and dynamics of civil resistance in West Papua. Here, the indigenous population has staged protests, boycotts, strikes and other nonviolent actions against repressive rule.This is the first in-depth account of civilian-led insurrection in West Papua, a movement that has transitioned from guerrilla warfare to persistent nonviolent resistance. MacLeod analyses several case studies, including tax resistance that pre-dates Gandhi's Salt March by two decades, worker strikes at the world's largest gold and copper mine, daring attempts to escape Indonesian rule by dugout canoe, and the collection of a petition in which signing meant to risk being shot dead.Merdeka and the Morning Star is a must-read for all those interested in Indonesia, the Pacific, self-determination struggles and nonviolent ways out of occupation. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"University of Queensland Press,","dateSaved":"1504498500","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71158","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71158&isn=9780702255700&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71158&isn=9780702255700&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71158&isn=9780702255700&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780702255700","title":"Ghost River","author":"Birch, Tony.","subject":["FICTION General","Fiction","FICTION Coming of Age"],"topic":["Fiction.","FICTION \/ Coming of Age","FICTION \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"The highly anticipated new novel from the Miles Franklin-shortlisted author of Blood 'You find yourself down at the bottom of the river, for some it's time to give into her.

Chris Masters'In this engrossing study Tom Roberts draws on a remarkable range of sources, many for the first time, to show how Keith Murdoch succeeded in his ambition.' Stuart Macintyre, author of The History Wars Following the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, Rupert Murdoch said his greatest regret was that he had let his father down. Popular history views Sir Keith Murdoch (1885-1952) as a fearless war correspondent - author of the famous letter that led to the evacuation of the Anzac force from Gallipoli - and a principled journalist and dedicated family man who, on his death, left a single provincial newspaper to Rupert. This benign reputation is unsurprising: the two previously published biographies of Keith were Murdoch family commissions. But is there another side to the story of Keith's success and the origins of News Corporation? Before Rupert is an unflinching prequel to the saga of the Murdoch family's rise to power. Historian Tom Roberts draws on an unparalleled range of interviews, correspondence and archival sources to trace the genesis of the family's involvement with the news and entertainment industry and their resulting influence. Before Rupert explores how Keith Murdoch ruthlessly exploited his networks to gain ultimate control over Australia's media and political landscapes.With controversial revelations, this book shows how, by Rupert's birth, a pattern for the cut-throat exercise of power through an expanding media chain had been set - a course still followed to this day. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"University of Queensland Press,","dateSaved":"1504498500","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71160","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71160&isn=9780702255762&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71160&isn=9780702255762&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71160&isn=9780702255762&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780702255762","title":"Pixie Annat","author":"Clur, Colleen Ryan.","subject":["BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Women","Women -- Biography","Medicine","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Medical","Women"],"topic":["Medicine","Women","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Medical","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Women"],"genre":[],"description":"Isobel Mary \"Pixie\" Annat grew up in rural Queensland and trained to be a nurse shortly after World War II.

In this deeply personal book, Behrendt uses Eliza's tale as a starting point to interrogate how Aboriginal people - and indigenous people of other countries - have been portrayed in their colonizers' stories. Citing works as diverse as Robinson Crusoe and Coonardoo, she explores the tropes in these accounts, such as the supposed promiscuity of Aboriginal women, the Europeans' fixation on cannibalism, and the myth of the noble savage. Ultimately, Behrendt shows how these stories not only reflect the values of their storytellers but also reinforce those values - which in Australia led to the dispossession of Aboriginal people and the laws enforced against them. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"University of Queensland Press,","dateSaved":"1504498500","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71174","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71174&isn=9780702256349&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71174&isn=9780702256349&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71174&isn=9780702256349&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780702256349","title":"Napoleon's Roads","author":"Brooks, David.","subject":["Fiction","FICTION Short Stories single author","FICTION Literary"],"topic":["Fiction.","FICTION \/ Literary","FICTION \/ Short Stories (single author)"],"genre":[],"description":"A writer questions the architecture of words, struggling to capture his ideas before they are lost; a husband excavating beneath his house becomes mesmerised by silence and disappears in search of solitude; a lighthouse keeper dreams that he is a man dreaming that he is the keeper of a lighthouse.

His 50-year career, including two terms as Prime Minister, encompasses a crucial period of Papua New Guinea's history, particularly its coming of age from an Australian colony to a leading democratic nation in the South Pacific. Chan has played a significant role during these decades of political, economic and social change. Playing the Game offers unique insights into one of the world's most ancient and complex tribal cultures. It also explores the vexed issues of increasing corruption, government failure, and the unprecedented exploitation of its precious natural resources. In the first memoir by a Papua New Guinean leader in forty years, Sir Julius Chan explores his decision in 1997 to hire a private military force, Sandline International, to quell the ongoing civil crisis in Bougainville. This controversial deal sparked worldwide outrage, cost Sir Julius the prime ministership and led to ten years in the political wilderness. He was re-elected as Governor of New Ireland in 2007, aged 68, a seat he has held ever since. Playing the Game is an authentic and compelling account of Chan's private and political life, and offers a rare insight into how the modern nation of Papua New Guinea came to be, the vision and values it was founded on, and the extraordinary challenges it faces in the 21st century. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"University of Queensland Press,","dateSaved":"1504498501","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71195","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71195&isn=9780702257063&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71195&isn=9780702257063&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71195&isn=9780702257063&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780702257063","title":"Whisperings in the Blood","author":"Davidow, Shelley.","subject":["HISTORY Africa South Republic of South Africa","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Personal Memoirs","Autobiographies"],"topic":["Autobiographies.","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Personal Memoirs","HISTORY \/ Africa \/ South \/ Republic of South Africa"],"genre":[],"description":"An exquisitely compelling story of courage, destiny and the search for home When orphan girl Bertha Frank gets onto a ship in New York in February 1937 to go to South Africa to marry a man she's never met, she doesn't know that she is repeating a journey to escape poverty and the persecution of the Pogroms made by her father from Lithuania to America in 1913, or that she is foreshadowing a journey Shelley Davidow, her granddaughter, will make from South Africa to America decades into the future. In 1937, she doesn't know that it will be fifty years before she returns to visit her home, nor that she will live through tumultuous social upheaval in an Africa on the brink of transformation. As a hopeful young adult, she cannot imagine the beauty, the love and the irreparable loss she will experience as a Jewish migrant in South Africa. Nor does she know that far in the future, her grandchildren will retrace her steps backwards to escape the violent, decaying outpost of white colonialism. In the 1980s, at the height of Apartheid in South Africa, Shelley Davidow decides to run from her country, and spends the next two decades searching for home. Then, in 2012 she discovers a box of Bertha's letters and diaries. Shelley realises that her life is an echo of patterns and repeating journeys; that there is a whispering in the blood of our forebears that tells the story of all our lives. From the Pogroms of Eastern Europe, to America's Great Depression, to the rise and fall of Apartheid South Africa and finally to Australia in the 21st century, Whisperings in the Blood explores the emotional legacy that we inherit from our immigrant ancestors and the complex heartache of leaving the land of one's birth. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"University of Queensland Press,","dateSaved":"1504498501","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71196","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71196&isn=9780702257094&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71196&isn=9780702257094&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71196&isn=9780702257094&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780702257094","title":"Saltwater","author":"McLennan, Cathy.","subject":["Law","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Personal Memoirs","Law -- Biography","Autobiographies","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Lawyers Judges"],"topic":["Autobiographies.","Law","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Lawyers & Judges","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Personal Memoirs"],"genre":[],"description":"'Everyone knows that some of those kids are innocent . . . your dilemma is not whether the kids are innocent, but which of the kids are innocent.'When Cathy McLennan first steps into Townsville's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service as a young graduate she isn't expecting a major murder case to land on her desk.

Blessed because he had a family who refused to view his blindness as a handicap and who instilled in him a belief in his own abilities. Blessed because he had the determination to persevere when obstacles were put in his way. And now, after a long and successful career - from lawyer to company director to Human Rights Commissioner - he has written his story. Finding a Way shares his memories of love and support, of challenges and failures, and of overcoming the discrimination so many people with disabilities face. He writes of the importance of family, the value of courage and the unique experience of a life without one sense but with heightened awareness of the others. Alongside his life story, Innes shares ideas on advocacy for people with disabilities and outlines what remains to be done to fully include people with disabilities in Australian society. This fascinating and moving book offers a new perspective on supporting diversity in our community. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"University of Queensland Press,","dateSaved":"1504498501","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71202","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71202&isn=9780702257339&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71202&isn=9780702257339&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71202&isn=9780702257339&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780702257339","title":"All Is Given","author":"Neil, Linda.","subject":["Musicians","TRAVEL General","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Composers Musicians","Travel"],"topic":["Musicians.","Travel.","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Composers & Musicians","TRAVEL \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"In this captivating memoir, Linda Neil shares stories of travel, taking us from the glitz of Shanghai to wintry London, from the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar to inner-city Sydney.

'We made it angry,' whispered Simon.'When Simon Brent's parents are killed in a car accident he is taken to live with his mother's cousins, Edie and Charlie, on Wongadilla, their 5000 acre sheep station in the Hunter Valley. Simon, with his city attitudes, feels like an outsider. But Simon is not the only thing that doesn't belong. The arrival of heavy machinery intent on clearing the land brings to life the Nargun, a great rock, older than time itself, that has slowly dragged itself into the valley - and with it, a simmering rage that drives it to kill.

So why do we have such a difficult time accepting them as sexual creatures? For a society that loves to project sex onto women, we're not so keen on their free sexual expression. Doing It brings together some incredible female writers to reflect on why that might be, how they feel about sex, and why they love it. Women don't get to talk about this, or hear it, enough. Edited by renowned feminist Karen Pickering, Doing It celebrates women taking control of their sexual lives, with some brilliant writing on intimacy, physicality, gender and power. These stories encourage honest discussions about sex and remind us of simple truths: women's bodies are their own, everybody's idea of good sex is different, and loving sex is nothing to be ashamed of. Featuring some of Australia's most engaging voices, and some international stars, this exceptional collection combines the serious, the hilarious, the satirical, the personal, the political, and the downright sexy.

The most destructive attack was launched in December 1940; it is remembered today as \"the Christmas Blitz.\" Nearly 800 people lost their lives, and thousands more were injured, in two nights of raids ending with a devastating Christmas Eve that saw hundreds of tons of high explosive and thousands of incendiaries fall. The damage was so extensive that Nazi propaganda claimed the city had been burned to the ground. Attacks continued into 1941 and beyond, and landmarks such as the cathedral, the Free Trade Hall, the Royal Infirmary, and the Royal Exchange were all to suffer. At Old Trafford, too, a bomb wrecked the pitch and demolished the stands.

Latterly, this family-run business has been crowned with box office gold and recognized by motion picture academies around the world. However, it has not always been smooth sailing. Changing tax regimes forced 007 to relocate to France and Mexico; changing fashions and politics led to box office disappointments; and changing studio regimes and business disputes all but killed the franchise while the rise of competing action heroes displaced Bond's place in popular culture. But against all odds the filmmakers continue to wring new life from the series, and 2012's Skyfall saw both huge critical and commercial success, crowning 007 as the undisputed king of the action genre.

Henry V built the Jesus, the first ship of 1000 tons, followed by the Grace Dieu of 1400 tons. Why didn't't the French stop him at sea? Henry V (1413-1422) conquered Normandy and forced the French king to accept him as heir to the French throne. The vital part played in these victories by English sailors and ships deserves to be better understood. Henry understood sea power and used it to clear the way for his two invasions of France. This book explores the story of the men, ships, operations, and cutting-edge medieval technology of the English fleet, which included both the \"king's ships\" and privately-owned vessels. Using the detailed records of Henry's ships, other rich documentary sources, and archeological evidence, Henry V's Navy reconstructs the story of one of England's most effective, but least remembered navies.

While other books plot out the battles and examine the participation of the German divisions on the Westfront, there are no books that discuss the shared experience of both sides. The result of a close collaboration between a British and a German military historian, this history examines the commonality of frontline experience. Drawing upon unique archives, Peter Doyle and Robin Schafer examine the soldiers' lives, and examine cultural and military nuances that have so far been left untouched. Mapping out the lives of the men in the trenches, it concludes that Fritz and Tommy were not that far apart, geographically, physically, or emotionally. The soldiers on both sides went to war with high ideals; they experienced horror and misery, but also comradeship\/kameradschaft. And with increasing alienation from the people at home, they drew closer together, the Hun transformed into \"good old Gerry\" by the war's end. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498502","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71266","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71266&isn=9781555917654&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71266&isn=9781555917654&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71266&isn=9781555917654&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9781555917654","title":"Indians of the Pacific Northwest","author":"Deloria, Jr., Vine.","subject":["HISTORY Native American","Indians of North America","Indians of North America -- Social conditions","Indians of North America -- History","SOCIAL SCIENCE Ethnic Studies Native American Studies"],"topic":["Indians of North America History.","Indians of North America Social conditions.","HISTORY \/ Native American","SOCIAL SCIENCE \/ Ethnic Studies \/ Native American Studies"],"genre":[],"description":"The Pacific Northwest was one of the most populated and prosperous regions for Native Americans before the coming of the white man.

Magnifying the challenge is the rapidly increasing volume and complexity of data, as well as regulatory compliance as it relates to data. In this book, Sunil Soares provides a practical guide for today's chief data officers to manage data as an asset while delivering the trusted data required to power business initiatives, from the tactical to the transformative. The guide describes the relationship between the CDO and the data governance team, whose task is the formulation of policy to optimize, secure, and leverage information as an enterprise asset by aligning the objectives of multiple functions. Soares provides unique insight into the role of the CDO and presents a blueprint for implementing data governance successfully within the context of the position. With practical advice CDOs need, this book helps establish new data governance practices or mature existing practices. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"MC Press,","dateSaved":"1504498503","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71280","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71280&isn=9781590125434&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71280&isn=9781590125434&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71280&isn=9781590125434&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9781590125434","title":"Touch of the Tropics","author":"","subject":["Decoration and ornament","Handicraft","CRAFTS HOBBIES General","CRAFTS HOBBIES Decorating"],"topic":["Decoration and ornament.","Handicraft.","CRAFTS & HOBBIES \/ Decorating","CRAFTS & HOBBIES \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"These brightly colored coasters and tissue cover are reminiscent of a tropical resort.

Bobby Joe possesses second sight, a gift passed down from the Choctaw side of his blood line. He is dark of eye and skin, mercurial and intense. Dev is possessed of preternatural physical strength, violet of eye and light of skin, laid-back and gentle - unless crossed. Along with Jack Lee, with whom they have a long friendship from their days at the University of Georgia, they are both handy in a tight spot. Bobby Joe is the one who comes up with the idea of going to Brazil, and who dubs himself and Dev \"dinosaurs\" and Brazil a fitting \"heaven\" for their final retirement. Behind it is the fact that he has discovered he has relatives there. They are descendants of a group called 'confederados', who left for Brazil at the end of the Civil War rather than surrender. Upon meeting them, his family reunion turns out to be an event that shakes his world. Meanwhile, Jack Lee barely escapes with his life when the law raids his cabin. Warrants have been issued relating to the time he investigated the murder of his old partner in the 'herb' Trade, and Jack is forced to go on the run. Bobby Joe and Dev invite him to join them in Brazil, where they have been set up in style by another old friend. He is a former exchange student who also attended UGA, and who presents the public persona of a successful businessman and political fixer, but is in reality something else altogether. Jack makes it to Brazil, but with the law on his trail. The dramatic tension in this novel derives from the collision of these outlaws and the extra-legal U.S. agents that are sent to deal with them, and from the wild card involvement of a renegade agent with his own agenda: the settling of scores with Bobby Joe and Dev, whom he considers to be the source of his very special misery.The 'outlaws' survive to fight another day, but they have been bloodied, and storm clouds are gathering on the horizon. The quiet retirement that Bobby Joe and Dev had hoped for seems to be elusive, and Jack's desire for a quiet place to meditate seems to be out of reach. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"HighLine Editions,","dateSaved":"1504498503","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71290","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71290&isn=9781681209210&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71290&isn=9781681209210&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71290&isn=9781681209210&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9781681209210","title":"Outlaw Custom","author":"Joseph, Henry.","subject":["FICTION Religious"],"topic":["FICTION \/ Religious"],"genre":[],"description":"After a violent encounter with the Feds, retired 'herb' smugglers Bobby Joe (of Choctaw descent), Dev (possessing preternatural strength), and Jack Lee, move up to a mountain estate in Visconde de Maua? in Brazil. They each have women in their lives: Bobby Joe has a young son with an old love from the States, Dev has settled with a Brazilian lady, and Jack is in a celibate marriage with an old love who allows him space to pursue his spiritual practice. On the surface, all seems well, but forces are building from two different directions that could combine into a deadly pincer movement.Joa~o Silva, an old Brazilian friend from their days at the University of Georgia, visits with news of the systematic murdering of street children all over Brazil. He tells them he is going to try to stop it, and speaks of another old friend who oversees a 'herb' plantation in Bahia. He breaks out samples and speaks of the millions of dollars he will need to defend the street children. Bobby Joe rolls a fat joint and then stuns his friends with an announcement. He proposes they come out of retirement to smuggle one last load to help Joa~o's cause.This sets in train a series of events with mortal consequences. A load is successfully smuggled into the United States, and Joa~o is given the money. However, enemies emerge and they find common interest with the extra-legal U.S. agents who are in pursuit of the trio. A combined force launches a raid on the estate, but it has nothing to do with warrants, or arrests. Jack Lee is not present when it occurs at dawn one day, but hears the helicopters and afterwards discovers all of his friends and loved ones shot dead, except for Bobby Joe's son. He goes on the hunt and ultimately finds and kills the one who led the raid, and in the process uncovers secrets that leave him reeling. After securing Bobby Joe's son into the custody of Joa~o's lifetime love, he takes passage on a tramp freighter bound for India. Once again he is alone, bereft, and with blood on his hands, with the ringing words of his guru in his ears, spoken some twenty years before and now seemingly bitterly prophetic and utterly accurate. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"HighLine Editions,","dateSaved":"1504498503","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71291","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71291&isn=9781681209258&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71291&isn=9781681209258&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71291&isn=9781681209258&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9781681209258","title":"Om and The Crossbones","author":"Joseph, Henry.","subject":["FICTION Religious"],"topic":["FICTION \/ Religious"],"genre":[],"description":"Jack Lee puts ashore, under cover of darkness, in old Bombay. In a fit of renunciation, he leaves his clothes on the ground, and walks away wearing only the om and crossbones, a long black flag with white crossed bones and the Sanskrit symbol 'om' in place of the skull. He had been given this by his outraged spouse when he had agreed to come out of retirement as a 'herb' smuggler and help Bobby Joe and Dev run one last load into the USA, so as to raise money for Joa~o Silva's campaign to help Brazilian street children.He then walks the forty miles to the abode of his guru, although strange events occur along the way and he moves forward as one in a dream. After reuniting with his guru, Sri Rudra Swami, his sadhana, or spiritual practice, explodes culminating with Rudra Swami's bestowal upon Jack of shaktipat; the direct transmission of spiritual energy from guru to disciple, and whereupon Rudra Swami promptly leaves his body. Left also is a newly named, and very stunned, Nageshwar( Lord of Cobras) in the care of Merlyn D'Cruz, a Portuguese Goan lady, who is owner and captain of the sloop Durga. Merlyn tells Nageshwar that she has orders to drive him to the abode of Rajendra Maharaj, a realized being and close friend of Rudra Swami, and Nageshwar, in his blissfully altered state, agrees to go.There in Udaipur, on the edge of the Thar desert in Rajasthan, Nageshwar, at the highest point in his life, meets 'Eightball' Barnett, a former operative in a quasi-governmental dirty tricks outfit that worked in South America to further the interests of U.S. corporations. 'Eightball' is now named Shivanath, and along with him Nageshwar also encounters the great leela, or cosmic play, which comes to its denouement, and brings with it a dark night of the soul to Nageshwar that is beyond his comprehension, and almost beyond his capacity to bear.After the unfolding of the events in Udaipur, Merlyn D'Cruz sails Nageshwar to Portugal , to 'O Fim Do Mundo', where his sadhana (spiritual practice) catches fire and he hurtles forward towards his goal. And there we leave Nageshwar, but not before his connection to 'Eightball' is revealed, and the ultimate purpose of the leela is made clear. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"HighLine Editions,","dateSaved":"1504498503","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71292","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71292&isn=9781682570524&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71292&isn=9781682570524&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71292&isn=9781682570524&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9781682570524","title":"Condition Critical","author":"Rothchild, Alice.","subject":["HISTORY Middle East Israel Palestine","Human rights","POLITICAL SCIENCE Human Rights"],"topic":["Human rights.","HISTORY \/ Middle East \/ Israel & Palestine","POLITICAL SCIENCE \/ Human Rights"],"genre":[],"description":"Since 2003, obstetrician Alice Rothchild has traveled annually to Israel\/Palestine with other concerned Americans, to learn about health and human rights situation of politically marginalized communities, especially Palestinians.

Over 35 profiles, including the Sunday school teachers who killed their spouses in order to be together, the nurse who wanted a baby so badly that she cut one from another woman's womb and the trainee vet who tried to kill his ex-girlfriend's entire family out of jealousy. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Summersdale,","dateSaved":"1504498503","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71301","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71301&isn=9781783728954&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71301&isn=9781783728954&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71301&isn=9781783728954&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9781783728954","title":"Torture","author":"Abbott, Geoffrey.","subject":["SOCIAL SCIENCE Penology","Corrections"],"topic":["Corrections.","SOCIAL SCIENCE \/ Penology"],"genre":[],"description":"In this account of the history of torture, Geoffrey Abbott guides us through some of the worst torture methods known to man, from chilli powder punishment to needles under nails, with a style both chilling and full of dark humor.

While many blamed his wife for his decline, Bertha Lawson alleged in April 1903 that Henry was habitually drunk and cruel, leading her to demand a judicial separation. In A Wife's Heart, Kerrie Davies provides a rare account of this tumultuous relationship from Bertha's perspective, in an era when women's rights were advancing considerably. Reproducing the Lawsons' letters - some of which have never been published - alongside her personal reflections, Davies explores the couple's courtship, marriage and eventual separation, as Bertha struggled to raise their two children as a single parent. A Wife's Heart offers an intimate portrait of the Lawsons' marriage, examined through a modern lens.

Determined to enlist despite a medical condition, he volunteered for military service, first as a regular soldier, then as a despatch rider. Offered a commission in the Royal Engineers, in 1915 he saw action at Gallipoli.Now a byword for catastrophic military disaster, the Gallipoli Campaign was the ill-conceived Allied invasion of the Dardanelles. The campaign stalled almost immediately, resulting in over half a million casualties on both sides.Lucky to survive, several years later Beecroft wrote a detailed memoir of his experiences. Discovered by his granddaughter and now reproduced here almost exactly as it was written nearly a century ago, Beecroft's vivid narrative takes us through those heady days of the declaration of war, enlistment, initial training, the bungled landing at Suvla Bay, and the exceptionally difficult conditions of the Gallipoli terrain. This is no mere jingoistic account. With a keen eye, Beecroft brings to life the men dogged by disease and exhaustion - ordinary soldiers who, even as they suffered the betrayal of incompetent leadership, displayed extraordinary reserves of heroism and bravery.Throughout this rare insight into what it was like for an ordinary 'civilian soldier' swept up in the fog of war, Beecroft's authentic voice still speaks honestly to us today - of comradeship and devotion to duty, of fear and facing death. Now published for the first time in the centenary year of the Gallipoli Campaign, this is a soldier's story in his own words. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Robert Hale,","dateSaved":"1504498505","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71339","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71339&isn=9780719818202&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71339&isn=9780719818202&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71339&isn=9780719818202&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780719818202","title":"Dead and Gone","author":"Kitson, Bill.","subject":["FICTION Mystery Detective Private Investigators"],"topic":["FICTION \/ Mystery & Detective \/ Private Investigators"],"genre":[],"description":"Dean Wilson knows any relationship with Naomi Macaulay is doomed.

The book follows in the tracks of the sisters in Brussels, describing their life in the city: though the school where they came to study French has now disappeared, there is still a lot to be seen of the city the sisters knew; two of Charlotte's four novels (Villette and The Professor) are also based on her spell abroad, which was pivotal to her both as a writer and personally, since she fell in love with her teacher Constantin Heger. Charlotte's moving and harrowing letters to Heger-a respectable married man-are reproduced in full here and belie the common image of her as the motherly and strait-laced Bronte.

This is followed by the new masculinity advocated by the Mod look in the 1960s, the influence of the place on rock and pop stars such as the Stones, Marc Almond, and Morrissey (all of whom themed songs on the subject) and the book closes in the 1990s, when online male escorts replaced rent boys on the Piccadilly railing. An exhilaratingly colorful recreation of the illegal occupation of one of London''s central commercial zones by lawless Dilly boys, this history is augmented by first-hand interviews with rent boys who worked the meat-rack in the 1970s as well as a chapter recording the author's personal friendship with the artist Francis Bacon. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Peter Owen Publishers,","dateSaved":"1504498505","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71368","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71368&isn=9780720616446&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71368&isn=9780720616446&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71368&isn=9780720616446&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780720616446","title":"Apollinaire in the Great War (1914-18)","author":"Hunter, David.","subject":["Authors -- Biography","Authors","HISTORY Military World War I","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Literary","World War 1914 1918"],"topic":["Authors","World War, 1914-1918.","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Literary","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War I"],"genre":[],"description":"A major literary figure in pre-war Paris, Guillaume Apollinaire volunteered for war in 1914, trained as an artilleryman and was posted in April 1915 to the Champagne front in northern France, participating in the bloody but little-known offensive that September and then moving into the front line as an infantry officer, before being wounded in March 1916 and invalided out of active service. Back in Paris, Apollinaire plunged back into the activities of the capital's artistic avant-garde, meanwhile publishing poetry, prose and plays that were deeply influenced by his involvement in the conflict. He died on 9 November 1918, two days before the Armistice, a victim of the influenza pandemic, but with a literary reputation secured, as well as a certain fame for coining the term 'Surrealism'. This book draws heavily on Apollinaire's writings to tell the story of his war years, within the wider context of the French experience of the Great War. In this period, Apollinaire also wrote hundreds of letters, the bulk of them to two women: Louise de Coligny, a flighty socialite of aristocratic origin, and Madeleine Pages, a young schoolteacher. In these letters he poured out his passionate feelings for both in often highly erotic poetry and prose, as well as giving detailed descriptions of his life as a front-line soldier. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Peter Owen Publishers,","dateSaved":"1504498505","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71369","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71369&isn=9780720616484&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71369&isn=9780720616484&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71369&isn=9780720616484&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780720616484","title":"Bridges","author":"Vesaas, Tarjei.","subject":["Fiction","FICTION Literary"],"topic":["Fiction.","FICTION \/ Literary"],"genre":[],"description":"A spare, powerful, supremely graceful novel from a giant of Norwegian literatureAs strange, unsettling, and memorable as The Ice Palace, this remarkable novel carries with it all the compassion, human insight, and lyrical power of all great Vesaas novels.

Hesse's growing Iiterary reputation coincided with his brief second marriage, and with his peaceful later years in Montagnola spent in the company of his third wife, Ninon, whom he married in 1931.

Fifty years ago, Alfred Hayes was regarded as one of the most interesting and original American novelists, and he deserves to be better known today. In Love is set in the Manhattan bar scene of the 1940s and reads like a Edward Hopper painting. A middle-aged man tells a young woman on an adjacent bar stool the story of his last love affair: a relationship in the thoroughly modern sense, full of misplaced lust and misunderstood emotion. He depicts the boy of his tale as moody and evasive, the girl as even worse. It was a mostly erratic affair, downbeat, dysfunctional, and on the brink of sinking without a trace until an unscrupulous millionaire intervened. The ensuing turmoil will be recognizable to anyone who has fallen into and then out of a relationship.

However, acclaimed historian Tom Ambrose-author of Godfather of the Revolution: The Life of Phillipe Egalite, Duc D'Orleans-has uncovered new details on \"Prinny\" that suggests that, for all his faults, George IV just may have been the most humane and amusing of all British monarchs, notwithstanding his love of the high life. Central to the story is the vast array of friends that populate a remarkable reign as Prince Regent and King. If Prinny, as they knew him, was so grotesquely foolish, how did he amass such a fascinating (and loyal) group of friends? Could any other British ruler count among his friends the country's most brilliant playwright (Richard Sheridan), or the wiliest statesman (Charles Fox), or the greatest political philosopher (Edmund Burke), not to mention perhaps the biggest loveable rogues' gallery London ever saw? The truth was that Prinny's occasional buffoonery and imposing girth made him the perfect target for political satirists and cartoonists-at their zenith during his reign-and his high qualities have been consistently overlooked. This warm, funny, and affectionate portrait displays George at his very best: delighting some of the finest minds of his generation, easily winning over his subjects and his family as well as treating his lovers with care and concern-and roistering with all his pals. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Peter Owen Publishers,","dateSaved":"1504498505","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71373","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71373&isn=9780720618297&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71373&isn=9780720618297&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71373&isn=9780720618297&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780720618297","title":"Strength to Say No","author":"Kalindi, Rekha.","subject":["Child development","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Women","Child development -- Study and teaching","SOCIAL SCIENCE Children s Studies","Women -- Biography","Women"],"topic":["Child development Study and teaching.","Women","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Women","SOCIAL SCIENCE \/ Children's Studies"],"genre":[],"description":"The true story of one girl who said \"no\" to tradition, and the effect it had upon a nationIn a remote village in Bengal, 11-year-old Rekha and her large family lived by rolling handmade cigarettes. She frequently observed the abrupt departure of her friends to go live with their mothers-in-law, where they were often treated like slaves. In spite of her youth, Rekha was aware of the harm done to these little girls. When, in their turn, her parents found a husband for her, a man she didn't know, she flew into a blinding rage at the idea of being taken away from any further schooling for good. After that, Rekha went from village to village to tell her story, and especially to explain the tragic consequences of early marriages. Thanks to her, several dozen children found the courage to say no to this tribal tradition. Her story gained national attention with India's newspaper hailing her for accomplishing change that the India government was incapable of making. Her exemplary journey gained her the recognition of the highest courts in the land, she has had an audience with the Indian President, and she is a recipient of India's National Bravery Award.

The privileges of rank aside, they were heirs to an unenviable role, and this study presents a unique portrait of strained apprenticeships for which there was no satisfactory precedent. Theirs was an upbringing dictated by dogmatic prescription and the heavy weight of obligation. As they pursued their lives according to their distinct personalities, they were never relieved of parental strictures, especially with regard to Queen Victoria and her eldest son, who filled the void with shallow interests, a profligate style of living, and the delights of Parisian nightlife. Inevitably the two princes were consigned to filling much of their time with insubstantial engagements not best suited to their characters and which reveal a common vulnerability. In the case of the future Edward VIII, he took a jaundiced view of matters of state and preferred dance floors, riding to hounds, and the ministrations of lovers. This book is the story of the heirs' progress that provides often unexpected perspectives on two public figures better known through the history of their respective reigns. For readers in this era, the similar position of Prince Charles ensures that this survey is a timely as well as a surprisingly entertaining read. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Peter Owen Publishers,","dateSaved":"1504498506","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71376","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71376&isn=9780720618402&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71376&isn=9780720618402&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71376&isn=9780720618402&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780720618402","title":"Black Box","author":"Popov, Alek.","subject":["FICTION Humorous","FICTION Mystery Detective General"],"topic":["FICTION \/ Humorous","FICTION \/ Mystery & Detective \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"In 1991, two Bulgarian brothers, Ned and Angel, receive an unusual package from the USA; a black plastic box containing the ashes of their late father, Professor Emmanuel Banov.

With the first mention of him coming in Old English ballads, it was long assumed that it was almost impossible that he ever existed at all, and that he firmly belonged in the realm of Errol Flynn, Kevin Costner, and even Mel Brooks movies. Only a few historians have dared to venture that Robin of Sherwood was, in fact, a living and breathing human being. Historian John Paul Davis, while undertaking research on the Knights Templar, has uncovered new evidence on the folk hero that suggests that his ties to that order were much closer than previously supposed. Sticking closely to historical sources as well as the ballads, Davis has produced a new portrait of this intriguing figure with colorful and unique insights into the era that he lived in, reckoned by Davis to be at least 100 years closer to our own than previously supposed. Lavishly illustrated throughout, Robin Hood: The Unknown Templar will be of keen interest to anyone who has been even merely charmed by his legend; potentially explosive reading for those with their own theories of who Robin Hood really was. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Peter Owen Publishers,","dateSaved":"1504498506","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71380","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71380&isn=9780720618686&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71380&isn=9780720618686&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71380&isn=9780720618686&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780720618686","title":"Cat Compendium","author":"Haining, Peter.","subject":["Art","ART Individual Artists General","ART European"],"topic":["Art, European.","Art.","ART \/ European","ART \/ Individual Artists \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"An in-depth biographical study, rare essays by and about Wain, and 60 of his best-loved illustrations make this a must-have for fans of the cult cat artistWith a wealth of Wain's most famous drawings, as well as rare writings by and about the artist, this is an ideal book for both Wain fans and cat-lovers in general. Louis Wain drew cats: cats playing poker, boxing, playing cricket, and doing almost any human activity. His pictures are widely available today as decorative motifs and popular prints, but in his day, the man dubbed the \"Hogarth of cat life\" was a celebrity who sold thousands of drawings and paintings to an insatiable public. From humble beginnings, Wain became a hugely successful popular artist, creating the Louis Wain Annual series and the first ever animated cat character, later acknowledged as the inspiration for Mickey Mouse. But after he lost his fortune, he lost his mind. He ended up in a provincial asylum, sketching psychedelic cats that were more fiend-like than feline. When his fate was discovered in 1925, the Royal Family and the Prime Minister joined a national campaign to rescue Wain. The artist never entirely recovered his health, but he was eventually moved to a better home, where he continued to draw and paint almost until his death in 1939. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Peter Owen Publishers,","dateSaved":"1504498506","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71381","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71381&isn=9780720618716&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71381&isn=9780720618716&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71381&isn=9780720618716&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780720618716","title":"Mad, Bad and Dangerous","author":"Ambrose, Tom.","subject":["BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Political","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Historical"],"topic":["BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Historical","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Political"],"genre":[],"description":"A penetrating and incisive study of the fanaticism and foibles of some of history's most illustrious namesFrom Assad to Nero, Gaddafi to Ivan The Terrible, this work attempts a thorough illumination of the minds of some of the most powerful people in history.

Apothecary Melchior is a divisive figure in the town: respected for his arcane knowledge and scientific curiosity but also slightly feared for his mystical witch-doctor aura. When a mysterious murder occurs in the castle, Melchior is called in to help find the killer and reveals a talent for detection. But Tallinn has a serial killer in its midst, and Melchior is tested to the limit in a plot with as many twists and turns as the turreted castle itself. Melchior uncovers a mystery surrounding St Olaf's and a secret society that has been controlling the town for years, uncovering truths about the town that may spell danger. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Peter Owen Publishers,","dateSaved":"1504498506","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71383","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71383&isn=9780720618785&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71383&isn=9780720618785&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71383&isn=9780720618785&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780720618785","title":"I Love You Madly","author":"Farr, Evelyn.","subject":["Authors -- Biography","Authors","Letters -- Literary collections","LITERARY COLLECTIONS Letters","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Literary","Letters"],"topic":["Authors","Letters","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Literary","LITERARY COLLECTIONS \/ Letters"],"genre":[],"description":"Delve deeper into the world of the BBC hit drama series Versailles, and discover the real Marie-Antoinette in this ground-breaking study of her secret love affair with the Swedish diplomat Count Axel von Fersen. For the first time an historian has compiled all the known letters between Swedish count Axel von Fersen and Marie-Antoinette, including six letters never before published. With unprecedented access to French and Swedish archives, Evelyn Farr has proven beyond doubt one of history's greatest romances. Axel von Fersen was Queen Marie-Antoinette's lover and loyal counsellor who gave her political advice from 1785 to the fall of the French monarchy at the time of the French Revolution. He organized the Royal Family's escape from Paris in 1791. Evelyn Farr's revelatory work on the subject also goes some way to proving that Count Fersen was in fact the biological father of Marie Antoinette's two younger children. Farr unveils the logistics and practicalities behind the romance; the use of code and invisible ink, the role of intermediaries, secret seals, double envelopes, codenames and the location of Fersen's clandestine lodgings at Versailles. I Love You Madly is a meticulously researched and enjoyable study of a forbidden love at a time of revolution. The letters portray a rebellious and independent queen who risked everything and broke all the rules to love the man who succeeded in conquering her heart. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"Peter Owen Publishers,","dateSaved":"1504498507","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71384","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71384&isn=9780720618822&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71384&isn=9780720618822&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71384&isn=9780720618822&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780720618822","title":"Half a Pound of Tuppenny Rice","author":"Coubrough, David.","subject":["FICTION Mystery Detective General"],"topic":["FICTION \/ Mystery & Detective \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"The events of August 1972-a poisoning, a drowning and a possible cover-up-disturb the 17-year-old Grant Morrison.

It has formed all of the nation's commissioned officers, many of whom have achieved distinction both within and outside of the Defence Forces. The story of this relatively unknown national institution is intriguing as it has attempted to fulfill the roles laid down for it in 1923 in training and instructing officers and officer candidates. The task has not been easy, as the Military College has inevitably been subject to the many changes and fluctuations in the duties, roles, and fortunes of the wider Defence Forces. Colonel Tom Hodson, a former instructor in the Military College and a graduate of Ecole de Guerre, Paris, will chart its history. He will recount how from its early predecessor, the Army School of Instruction, it has repeatedly re-invented itself, culminating in the requirement for today's modern institution to embrace and impart instruction based on the needs of NATO and European armies. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498507","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71397","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71397&isn=9780750957632&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71397&isn=9780750957632&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71397&isn=9780750957632&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750957632","title":"Bradford","author":"Hughes, Kathryn.","subject":["HISTORY Military World War I","World War 1914 1918","HISTORY Europe Great Britain"],"topic":["World War, 1914-1918.","HISTORY \/ Europe \/ Great Britain","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War I"],"genre":[],"description":"World War I claimed more than 995,000 British lives, and its legacy continues to be remembered today.

The central argument of the book is that there was not only a secret, internal \"cold war\" fought throughout the 1980s (a war that had started in the 1970s), but that the consequences of those years have huge implications for the importance and role of the state as it evolved into the twenty-first century outside parliamentary control. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498507","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71400","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71400&isn=9780750958165&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71400&isn=9780750958165&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71400&isn=9780750958165&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750958165","title":"Perilous Catch","author":"Smylie, Mike.","subject":["Food industry and trade","BUSINESS ECONOMICS Industries Food Industry","HISTORY Europe Great Britain"],"topic":["Food industry and trade.","BUSINESS & ECONOMICS \/ Industries \/ Food Industry","HISTORY \/ Europe \/ Great Britain"],"genre":[],"description":"This is the story of Britain's commercial fishermen, who have sailed out into the ravages of the surrounding seas to bring back the fish to feed their country for centuries.

However, this is not the case: in the 1960s Chichester faced the same challenges as all historic towns, and much was lost-but the brakes were applied in good time and it became one of the first conservation areas in the country. This book, the first of its kind, looks at how the Chichester fared in that turbulent decade, how it gained in its status as a city of culture with a new theater and museum, and how it expanded to meet the demands of its growing populace.

He created characters famous across the English-speaking world, such as Rupert Psmith, Stanley Ukridge, Uncle Fred, the inhabitants of the Drones Club, Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, and Lord Emsworth and his beloved Empress, all of whom remain as popular today as they were when they first appeared all those years ago. But behind all the brilliant metaphors that make us laugh out loud, there is a surprising background of reality. Wodehouse didn't create his stories from scratch; he used real settings and exaggerated the characteristics of people he knew.

In fiction, he was mentioned in a Gilbert Sullivan opera and in the bestselling biography The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher. In reality, he was a contradiction: a man of mystery who tried to keep out of the limelight, while at times he craved recognition and publicity. He was a busybody, a meddler, yet someone whose heart was ultimately in the right place. Newspaper accounts detail his work as a private detective in London, his association with The Society for the Protection of Young Females, his foiling of those involved in sex-trafficking, and his tracking down of abducted children-themes that remain relevant in the 21st century. What was his involvement in the American Civil War? Why did he place cryptic messages in the agony column of the Times? And why were the newspapers so interested in this Hungarian detective and adventurer while the police thoroughly disapproved of him? In this first biography of this complex character, author Bryan Kesselman answers these questions, and examines whether it was Pollaky who provided the inspiration for the literary greats Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498508","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71426","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71426&isn=9780750963329&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71426&isn=9780750963329&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71426&isn=9780750963329&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750963329","title":"Betrayal of Richard III","author":"Lamb, V.

Despite the constant threat of terrorism that was prevalent at the time, there is a touch of Yes, Prime Minister that runs through the narrative, which adds a surprisingly amusing element to this revelatory book. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498508","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71429","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71429&isn=9780750963350&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71429&isn=9780750963350&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71429&isn=9780750963350&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750963350","title":"Verneuil 1424","author":"Wadge, Richard.","subject":["HISTORY Military General","Military history","HISTORY Europe France"],"topic":["Military history.","HISTORY \/ Europe \/ France","HISTORY \/ Military \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"The first book about this decisive battle in the Hundred Years WarIn August, 1424, the armies of England, Scotland, and France met in the open fields outside the walls of Verneuil in a battle that would decide the future of the English conquests in France.

By 1914, a confirmed pacifist, she felt passionately that civilians suffered more than combatants. Throughout the war she was anxious for a negotiated peace. In Switzerland, in 1916, through the German Ambassador-extraordinarily-she obtained permission to visit German-occupied Belgium and Berlin. A chance meeting with the German Foreign Secretary made her realize peace talks were possible. She put forward a plan to get talks started, to which he agreed, but in England she was snubbed by the Foreign Office. She worked tirelessly for the release of civilian internees and better food for Belgium. Her \"Open Christmas Letter\" was answered in a letter by 155 prominent Pacifist and feminist German and Austrian women. Emily Hobhouse was an extraordinary woman and a key figure in the struggle for women's emancipation. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498508","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71431","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71431&isn=9780750963381&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71431&isn=9780750963381&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71431&isn=9780750963381&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750963381","title":"Wellington","author":"Sheffield, Gary.","subject":["BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Military","Military biography","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Historical"],"topic":["Military biography.","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Historical","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Military"],"genre":[],"description":"Wellington is a giant because he was one of the greatest military commanders in British history, an important figure in the emergence of Britain as a great imperial power, a man who dominated British society and politics for 35 years.

Along the way, the book dispels the popular notions that King John was an unredeemed tyrant, the baron's champions of civil liberty, and that Magna Carta was the foundation of democracy and universal freedom. The true story is much more intriguing than a simple fiction of good defeating evil, and the author tries to answer one of the great mysteries about the Charter: why today is it much more enthusiastically revered in America than it is in the country of its origin? But myths can be powerful. And the account of how this largely technical medieval document became an inspiration to those who have struggled over centuries to win democracy and freedom under the law reveals a great deal about our need for symbols and our inclination to believe what we want to believe. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498508","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71464","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71464&isn=9780750964586&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71464&isn=9780750964586&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71464&isn=9780750964586&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750964586","title":"Looking Down the Corridors","author":"Wright, Kevin.","subject":["HISTORY Europe General","HISTORY Military General","Military history"],"topic":["Military history.","HISTORY \/ Europe \/ General","HISTORY \/ Military \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"Between 1945 and 1990 the British Government mounted some of the most successful intelligence operations of the Cold War.

Despite being the longest urban battle between lightly armed irregular forces and the most professional Army of its day - in terms of ferocity, compared by the Germans themselves to the Battle of Stalingrad - the Warsaw Uprising still remains one of the least known chapters of World War II. In this first-hand account, the harrowing details of life under years of occupation and heavy urban combat are told with disarming authenticity, through the eyes of a 13-year-old boy. Hryniewicz was eight when the war began and 13 when he became a runner to the Commanding Officer of a Polish Home Army Unit, making him both witness and participant in the midst of the 63-day long battle. These impressive personal recollections are explored together with the author's broader insights into the connected events that so transformed the map of Europe, which continue to dictate geopolitics today Praised by eminent historians, authors and statesmen alike, the author's account stands as a cautionary tale about the brutal and lasting effects of war. As tensions in Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe continue to mount, this book serves as a timely reminder of the ever present dangers of Imperial annexation on Europe's eastern flank. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498509","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71481","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71481&isn=9780750964760&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71481&isn=9780750964760&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71481&isn=9780750964760&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750964760","title":"To Hell or Monto","author":"Curtis, Maurice.","subject":["HISTORY Europe Ireland"],"topic":["HISTORY \/ Europe \/ Ireland"],"genre":[],"description":"There was a time when the two most notorious red-light districts, not only in Ireland but in all of Europe, could be found on the streets of Dublin.

De Laszlo had pulled strings to be naturalized as British at the outbreak of World War I, but in 1919 he was referred to a public committee to revoke his naturalization. With the aid of skilled lawyer de Laszlo had the application overturned-however, newly discovered records show MI5 had evidence obtained from a top secret source that alleged that he was supplying the enemy with important information on politics and industrial production. Crucially, the source's anonymity prevented MI5 from presenting evidence to the tribunal. But was de Laszlo a secret agent and was MI5's source really as they claimed?

Often using contemporary sources, this gripping account fills a gap in Cook history and attempts to catch something of that exciting, violent, gossipy but largely untaught and unknown, period through which these vessels and their people sailed literally and figuratively between the old world and the new. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498509","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71495","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71495&isn=9780750965507&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71495&isn=9780750965507&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71495&isn=9780750965507&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750965507","title":"From Nighthawk to Spitfire","author":"Shelton, John K.","subject":["Scientists -- Biography","Aeronautics Military","HISTORY Military Aviation","Scientists","Aeronautics Military -- History","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Science Technology"],"topic":["Aeronautics, Military History.","Scientists","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Science & Technology","HISTORY \/ Military \/ Aviation"],"genre":[],"description":"R. J. Mitchell was virtually self-taught; surprisingly, almost all his other aircraft 24 aircraft were slow-flying seaplanes. How a lad from the land-locked Midlands, apprenticed to a locomotive works, came to be responsible for the Spitfire is a great tale in itself. This detailed book tells us how Mitchell learned his trade-from 1916, contributing to the production of the cumbersome Night Hawk, designed to combat the German Zeppelin threat, and gradually coming to produce record-breaking racing floatplanes which in 1931 won outright the prestigious international Schneider Trophy. Mitchell was thus well placed to design a high speed aircraft when war began to threaten, but Dr. Shelton reveals the production of the famous fighter was by no means a certainty and how, indeed, its vital contribution to winning the Battle of Britain was \"a very close run thing.\" --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498509","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71496","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71496&isn=9780750965514&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71496&isn=9780750965514&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71496&isn=9780750965514&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750965514","title":"Lifeline Across the Sea","author":"Williams, David L.","subject":["HISTORY Military World War II","World War 1939 1945","Ships","Ships -- History","TRANSPORTATION Ships Shipbuilding History"],"topic":["Ships History.","World War, 1939-1945.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War II","TRANSPORTATION \/ Ships & Shipbuilding \/ History"],"genre":[],"description":"Telling the gripping story of the mercy ships of the Second World War, this is the first book to identify and describe in detail all the ships engaged in the repatriation of wartime diplomats, civilians, and prisoners Behind the scenes during the Second World War, agreements were negotiated for wounded or gravely ill prisoners and \"Protected Personnel\"-diplomats, clergy, civilians, and alien internees-to be safely exchanged, a little-known dimension of the war. Conducted under the International Red Cross and neutral intermediaries, exchanges were arranged individually between Allied nations and the Axis belligerents. A group of 50 ships, in special livery, were uniquely engaged in this highly dangerous work, sailing through hostile waters alone and undefended, and conspicuously illuminated at night.

Her contributions to the war effort included working on her father's farm, nursing in the local military hospital, and serving in the ATS. Her future husband, David McCormick, served with the 4th RHA in North Africa. Captured in December 1941, he endured the remainder of the war in prison camps in Italy and Germany. Miranda McCormick has skillfully woven together her forebears' very differing wartime experiences. Of specific interest to social, military, and agricultural historians, for the general reader this is also an intensely human-at times heart-rending - story of love, duty, separation, temptation, guilt, and eventual reunion.

Katanga 1960 tells, for the first time, the full story of the Congolese province that declared independence and found itself at war with the world. The Congo had no intention of allowing the renegade region to secede, and neither did the CIA, the KGB, or the United Nations. It was a fantastically uneven battle. The UN fielded soldiers from twenty nations, America paid the bills, and the Soviets intrigued behind the scenes. Yet to everyone's surprise the new nation's rag-tag army of local gendarmes, jungle tribesmen and, controversially, European mercenaries, refused to give in.

Blunderhead was the only SOE operation in a country that had been incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, but it involved no cooperation with Moscow (although SOE sought permission for the go-ahead). Uniquely, the operation was not initiated by SOE, but was rather the brainchild of Ronald Sydney Seth (after the war he reinvented himself as Dr. Chartham, a pioneering sexologist). Seth left entertaining accounts of his training and these throw light on his extraordinary character and the ways in which SOE sought to prepare its agents. His mission was a failure: Seth was captured, interrogated by the Germans, and imprisoned. He claimed that he was saved from a public hanging by the failure to open at the last minute of the trapdoor on the scaffold. From Tallinn he was transferred to a succession of prisons in the Baltic and Germany and ended up in Paris with a mistress where he trained to be a German secret agent.

Relayed to the author in the final years of her life, Elaine's true story of courage and humor in testing times is more intriguing, more compelling than fiction. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498510","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71527","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71527&isn=9780750966634&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71527&isn=9780750966634&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71527&isn=9780750966634&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750966634","title":"1415 Agincourt","author":"Curry, Anne.","subject":["HISTORY Military Other","Military history","Middle Ages","HISTORY Medieval"],"topic":["Middle Ages.","Military history.","HISTORY \/ Medieval","HISTORY \/ Military \/ Other"],"genre":[],"description":"As night fell in Picardy on Thursday October 24, 1415, Henry V and his English troops, worn down by their long march after the taking of Harfleur and diminished by the dysentery they had suffered there, can little have dreamt that the battle of the next day would give them one of the most complete victories ever won.

A prolific burglar, car thief, fraudster, and gunman, he possessed a deep loathing of anyone in authority. In addition, he was a master of disguise and a veritable Houdini when it came to escaping from prison. After shooting a policeman during a botched burglary, he escaped from court on Christmas Eve, 1982. When police believed him to be in a yellow Mini in the Earls Court area with his girlfriend, they opened fire, only to discover they had shot an entirely innocent man - a 26-year-old film editor named Steven Waldorf. The investigation became a cause celebre at the time, and was subsequently taken over by Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, of which the author was a member. One of the biggest manhunts in the history of the Metropolitan Police ensued, before Martin was finally arrested after dramatically fleeing down the tracks between two Underground stations. Author Dick Kirby reveals for the first time the inside story of the hunt for \"the most dangerous man in London,\" whose eventual arrest brought to an end one of the most contentious investigations in Met history. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498510","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71556","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71556&isn=9780750968591&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71556&isn=9780750968591&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71556&isn=9780750968591&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750968591","title":"Where Dragons Soar","author":"Castle, Pete.","subject":["FICTION Fairy Tales Folk Tales Legends Mythology","Folklore","FICTION Short Stories single author"],"topic":["Folklore.","FICTION \/ Fairy Tales, Folk Tales, Legends & Mythology","FICTION \/ Short Stories (single author)"],"genre":[],"description":"Passed down from generation to generation, the stories in this collection are as ancient and recent, powerful and fantastical, imaginary and magical as the animals of myth and legend they feature.

The first battle was initiated by the British Navy, who had orders to prevent a German landing. U-boats failed to spot the patrolling British destroyer flotilla and, early in the morning on April 10th, they sank two German destroyers and six merchant ships in the harbor. The Germans retreated but, unbeknown to the British, five more destroyers were anchored nearby. Battle continued on April 13th. In total, 10 destroyers sank-only U51 survived by escaping to sea.

The basic facts were published in the Times and the Bucks Free Press: \"She had binoculars round her neck, spied illicit lovers, was spotted, and one or both of them killed her,\" surmised Detective Chief Inspector Jack \"Razor\" Williams of New Scotland Yard. He had received fifty police commendations in his career, yet not one for a murder case. Unsurprisingly, within weeks the police operation wound down, Williams retired, and another Cold Case hit the statistics. However, fifty years later amateur sleuth and author Monica Weller set about solving the murder - without the help of the prohibited files. As she sifted the fresh evidence, a number of suspects and sinister motives began to emerge. Not a random killing, then. She uncovered secret passions, deep jealousies, unusual relationships, and a victim with a dark past. Finally, her persistence and dedication were dramatically rewarded when she uncovered the identity of the murderer - revealed here for the first time. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498511","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71581","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71581&isn=9780750968850&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71581&isn=9780750968850&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71581&isn=9780750968850&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750968850","title":"Sisters of the Somme","author":"Starns, Penny.","subject":["HISTORY Military World War I","World War 1914 1918","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Historical"],"topic":["World War, 1914-1918.","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Historical","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War I"],"genre":[],"description":"Following the outbreak WWI, the British Red Cross appealed for volunteers to train as frontline medical staff, and a major volunteer field hospital was built at Etaples in France. Women volunteered for a variety of reasons. Some believed that they were responding to a vocational or religious calling, others were following a sweetheart to the front, whereas others had been carried away on the wave of jingoistic patriotism that had gripped the nation in 1914. One such volunteer was Lily Fielding. Despite her training, however, Lily and the young friends she was to make at the Somme were ill-prepared for the stench of gangrene and trench foot.

When submarine warfare became more intense, food shortages occurred and it became vital for Britain to grow more and eat less food.

It was a worrying time overseas too: Great Britain's supremacy was increasingly challenged, and the warships in Devon's harbors and army maneuvers on the moors drew many comments as the storm clouds began to gather over Europe. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498511","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71611","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71611&isn=9780750969253&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71611&isn=9780750969253&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71611&isn=9780750969253&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750969253","title":"Royal Ghost","author":"Stratmann, Linda.","subject":["FICTION Thrillers Crime"],"topic":["FICTION \/ Thrillers \/ Crime"],"genre":[],"description":"Brighton, 1871: a book by two respectable spinsters claiming to have seen the ghost of the Prince Regent in Brighton Pavilion shocks the town and attracts the attention of spiritualist Arthur Wallace Hope.

As a Gurkha officer, J. P. Cross had many unusual experiences in his long career: in 1945, for example, he was attached to a Japanese battalion in Indochina which was fighting for the British against the Viet Minh, and the only photograph taken of this Japanese unit finally laying down its weapons appears in this book. Later, he just managed to resolve a potentially deadly dispute between an offended Gurkha and a visiting South Vietnamese trainee at the Jungle Warfare School. He also describes several seemingly supernatural experiences whilst serving with troops from a culture where such things are firmly believed in.

After the Italian armistice that followed the downfall of Il Duce Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill seized the opportunity to open a new front in the eastern Mediterranean, thereby increasing the pressure against Germany and at the same time hoping to provide an incentive for Turkey to join the Allies. Rejected by the Americans, it was a strategy fraught with difficulties and, ultimately, one doomed to failure. Spearheaded by the Long Range Desert Group and the Special Boat Squadron, British garrison troops were dispatched to the Aegean with the support of naval units, but with little or no air cover. They were opposed by German assault troops with the advantage of overwhelming air superiority.

The family disobeys the instructions and informs the authorities, and together they struggle to understand and carry out their instructions in a complex cat-and-mouse game with one desperate aim: to get Lesley back alive. The recent release of Home Office papers allows author Gordon Lowe to go behind the scenes and examine how a combination of bad luck and mistakes on the part of both the police and Donald Neilson stacked the odds against a successful resolution to one of the century's most despicable crimes. Here Lowe details what happened to Lesley as she lay naked and shackled by a steel noose at the bottom of a wet drainage shaft with a man in a black hood, the Black Panther, as her only contact with the outside world. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71644","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71644&isn=9780750969673&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71644&isn=9780750969673&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71644&isn=9780750969673&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750969673","title":"Julius Caesar","author":"Wiseman, T.P.","subject":["BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Military","Military biography","BIOGRAPHY AUTOBIOGRAPHY Historical"],"topic":["Military biography.","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Historical","BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Military"],"genre":[],"description":"Why is Caesar a giant?

Scotland's response to the Great War has, up until now, largely been marginalized or ignored. With a proportionally higher number of volunteers than any other home nation, Scotland's youth played a significant part in Britain's war effort. Here is the first study of Scotland's response to the call to arms; the true story behind the raising, the training, life in the trenches, and the sacrifices faced by those battalions raised in Scotland. This book focuses on the experiences of those who served in the Scottish divisions. Charting the course of emotions from initial enthusiasm in August 1914 through to outright disillusionment with the continuation of the war in 1917, the author clearly shows how life at the front line produced both physical and emotional changes in those caught up in the horrors of trench warfare. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71658","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71658&isn=9780750979061&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71658&isn=9780750979061&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71658&isn=9780750979061&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750979061","title":"Gallipoli 1915","author":"Travers, Tim.","subject":["HISTORY Military World War I","World War 1914 1918"],"topic":["World War, 1914-1918.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War I"],"genre":[],"description":"Why was the Allied naval assault of February\/March 1915 so unsuccessful? Did the Ottoman Turks have knowledge of the Allied landings of April 25, 1915? And did Sir Ian Hamilton, the overall commander of the Allied forces at Gallipoli, really make a mistake in his intervention at Suvla? These questions and the key issue of why the Ottoman Turks won the 1915 Gallipoli campaign, or why the Allies lost it, have never been satisfactorily answered. This new history of the Gallipoli campaign aims to answer them, while also telling the story of what actually happened through the voices of British, Australian, and Turkish soldiers. In order to properly understand the bloody events of 1915, Tim Travers is the first historian of Gallipoli to use the general Staff Ottoman archives in Ankara to tell the other side of the story. Wide-ranging research in the Turkish archives as well as those in Australia, Britain, France and New Zealand, plus a significant newly discovered German source, has produced a startling new interpretation of the 1915 conflict. Moving from a study of the Western Front, Tim Travers has produced a challenging analysis of the enduring mysteries of the Gallipoli campaign. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71659","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71659&isn=9780750979078&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71659&isn=9780750979078&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71659&isn=9780750979078&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750979078","title":"Smoke and Mirrors","author":"Lake, Deborah.","subject":["HISTORY Military World War II","World War 1939 1945","Ships","Ships -- History","TRANSPORTATION Ships Shipbuilding History"],"topic":["Ships History.","World War, 1939-1945.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War II","TRANSPORTATION \/ Ships & Shipbuilding \/ History"],"genre":[],"description":"The Q-ship, an ordinary merchant vessel with concealed guns, came into its own during World War I, when used by the Royal Navy to trap and destroy German U-boats.

British gunners were accurate, effective, and efficient, and provided better fire support for their armored and infantry colleagues than in any other army. The RA provided much more than field and medium artillery battlefield support. Gunner regiments manned anti-tank guns on the frontline and light anti-aircraft guns in divisional regiments to defend against air attack at home and abroad. The RA also helped to protect convoys that brought essential supplies to Britain, and AA gunners had their finest hour when they destroyed the majority of the V-1 flying bombs launched against Britain from June 1944. This volume thoroughly covers the RAs state of preparedness in 1939; the many developments that were introduced during the war, including aerial observation and self-propelled artillery; the growth of the regiment; and its effectiveness in its many roles. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71661","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71661&isn=9780750979320&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71661&isn=9780750979320&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71661&isn=9780750979320&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750979320","title":"Blitz on Britain","author":"Price, Alfred.","subject":["HISTORY Military World War II","World War 1939 1945"],"topic":["World War, 1939-1945.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War II"],"genre":[],"description":"During the latter half of the 1930s, the fear of a possible aerial knock-out on Great Britain became a dominating factor in the formulation of national policy. This text examines how justified these pre-war fears were in light of the Luftwaffe's capabilities in 1939 and describes the bombing attacks on Britain during the years that followed, together with the operations of the defenses to parry them. From the start, the air defenses proved able to take a heavy toll on the bombers attacking Britain by day. By night it was a different matter. Initially, the fighter and gun defenses were lucky if between them they were able to knock out one or two bombers out of 300 or 400 involved in a night attack. From this poor beginning the defenses improved out of all recognition and when the Germans launched a series of attacks on London early in 1944, it cost them one bomber and four trained crewmen for every five British civilians killed. Blitz on Britain makes compelling reading for anyone interested in the Luftwaffe's wartime raids on Britain, and how the air defenses ultimately succeeded in defeating this long running aerial onslaught. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71662","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71662&isn=9780750979337&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71662&isn=9780750979337&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71662&isn=9780750979337&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750979337","title":"Wolf's Lair","author":"Baxter, Ian.","subject":["HISTORY Military World War II","World War 1939 1945"],"topic":["World War, 1939-1945.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War II"],"genre":[],"description":"The Wolf's Lair was the most important German command post building during World War II. Orders sent from these secret headquarters would play a massive part in the outcome of the war.

Baxter extensively examines life within the Fuhrerhauptquartiere, where Hilter planned and gossiped with his associates. However, as defeat loomed, Hitler surrounded himself not with his intimate circle of friends, but what he considered were illiterate soldiers. Baxter shows how Hitler's contempt for his war staff grew, and describes, during the onset of the traumatic German military reverses in Russia, how Hitler tried to infuse determination into his generals and friends, despite his rapid deterioration in health. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71663","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71663&isn=9780750979344&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71663&isn=9780750979344&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71663&isn=9780750979344&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750979344","title":"Death by Design","author":"Beale, Catherine.","subject":[],"topic":[],"genre":[],"description":"At the outbreak of war in 1939 British tank crews were ill-equipped, under trained and badly led.

By 1943 he was in mainland Italy, where he spent the rest of the war. Beautifully written, Alex's letters offer an intimate account of war from a regular \"desert rat\" and cover such daily matters as football, insects, and sandstorms alongside accounts of survival in the Italian mountains, escape during the retreat at Tobruk, and leave in Cairo and Palestine. Nan wrote as many letters to Alex as he wrote to her, but he had a ritual of burning the letters as he went so that he would not have to carry them with him and sadly none have survived.

The U-boats proved to be little more than pinpricks against the landings, and advancing Anglo-American armies had driven them out of their French west Atlantic bases all the way back to Norway by September 1944. Yet the U-boat force mounted a sustained and effective campaign from their Norwegian bases. Admiral Doenitz revived the U-boat War against Allied merchant shipping with new inventions in the face of a massive Allied naval defense while Germany collapsed. The east coast waters were shallow and heavily mined. Other German naval forces made a significant contribution. The campaign also saw the first and only appearances of the new Type XXIII electric U-boats, a radically new submarine design, the forerunner of modern diesel-electric submarines. John White examines in detail the U-boat reaction to the Normandy Landings in June 1944, the Norwegian U-boat bases, German torpedoes, the interference by U-boat Command, the Scapa Flow carrier operation, and the Allied response up to the final surrender in May 1945. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71667","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71667&isn=9780750979542&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71667&isn=9780750979542&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71667&isn=9780750979542&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750979542","title":"Destroyer Actions","author":"Plevy, Harry.","subject":["HISTORY Military General","Military history"],"topic":["Military history.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"This book focuses on the human side of destroyer actions in the first eight months of the War, using eyewitness accounts, many previously unpublished, of those who participated or played a part in the actions.

By 1943 the war effort was in danger of grinding to a halt because of a lack of coal. In answer, Minister of Labour Ernest Bevin sought service volunteers, and compulsorily sent 20,000 18-year-olds-who had expected to fight for their country-down the mines with them. Some were so angry that they preferred to go to prison, though the majority went to do their best. But some were psychologically or physically unsuited to such dangerous and arduous work. Many were injured; some died.

Aircraft, armored vehicles, and new forms of motorized transport became available to make possible a fresh style of offensive warfare when the next European war began in 1939.

Using interviews, personal letters, and unpublished diaries, some supplied by historian Marcin Zborska in Warsaw and published for the first time, Ian Baxter gives a fascinating insight into the camp that saw the murder of some 800,000 Jews. The book paints a chilling picture of the staff at Treblinka, showing the SS-men during breaks from their murderous activities, relaxing in their barracks, or visiting the camp zoo with their families. Diary extracts will allow a reader inside the heads of these men who, in some cases felt themselves fortunate to be posted at Treblinka. The inner working of the camp are exposed here in unprecedented detail-from the techniques of mass murder to the bizarre rituals that developed within the camp. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71677","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71677&isn=9780750979818&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71677&isn=9780750979818&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71677&isn=9780750979818&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750979818","title":"Spirit of the Blue","author":"Thomas, Hugh.","subject":["Aeronautics Military","HISTORY Military World War II","HISTORY Military Aviation","World War 1939 1945","Aeronautics Military -- History"],"topic":["Aeronautics, Military History.","World War, 1939-1945.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ Aviation","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War II"],"genre":[],"description":"Few RAF pilots flew operationally from the beginning to the end of the Second World War. Fewer still can claim to have taken part in the Battle of France, Battle of Britain, El Alamein, and the D-Day landings as well as bomber escort duties in the closing days of the war. Peter Ayerst is one such man and his tale is, as yet, untold. Illustrated with photographs, this is the previously unpublished story of an RAF Second World War fighter pilot ace. Peter Ayerst joined the RAF in 1938 on a short service commission and was despatched as part of the Advanced Air Striking Force to France at the beginning of September 1939, gaining his first kills. He became the first RAF pilot to engage a Bf 109 in combat and survived a confrontation with twenty-seven enemy aircraft, his Hurricane riddled with bullets. With the fall of France, Peter was recalled to England where he spent the Battle of Britain summer of 1940 instructing at No. 7 OTU Hawarden, shooting down a Heinkel He 111 bomber.Peter was then posted to North Africa in 1942 where he was shot down in the desrt and crash-landed in a minefield! He flew a variety of missions, culminating in a strafing of Axis motor targets 400 miles behind enemy lines, personally detroying a Junkers Ju 52 and seventeen vehicles. Following a period of instructing in South Africa, Peter returned to Britain in 1944, flying high-altitude Spitfires on interception flights over France. He took part in escort duties on D-Day and at the end of 1944 he was awarded the DFC. Peter also flew bomber escort duties of the Ruhr and escorted King George VI's personal flight. In the closing months of the war he flew Spitfires in support of mass daylight bomber raids deep into Germany.By the war's end, Peter had flown every operational mark of Spitfire and Hurricane in the RAF's inventory. Alex Henshaw was instrumental in choosing him as a test pilot for Vickers at Castle Bromwich where he flew production Spitfire Mk XIs, XVIs and 22s. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71678","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71678&isn=9780750979825&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71678&isn=9780750979825&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71678&isn=9780750979825&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750979825","title":"Restless Revolutionaries","author":"Bloom, Clive.","subject":["Revolutions","HISTORY Revolutionary","Revolutions -- History","HISTORY Europe Great Britain"],"topic":["Revolutions History.","HISTORY \/ Europe \/ Great Britain","HISTORY \/ Revolutionary"],"genre":[],"description":"From regicides to revolutionaries; from fascists to anarchists; from Tom Paine to Tom Wintringham, this book is a history of noble ideals and crushing failures.

Almost three million U. S. men and women traveled thousands of miles to fight for what was a questionable cause. American involvement was at its peak from 1965-69 when some 500,000 American troops were in Vietnam. America's involvement in Vietnam ended in 1973. At its peak, the war cost more than one billion dollars a day, and a total of seven million bombs were dropped-more than the entire total of all participants in World War II. By April 1975, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, had fallen to the communist North and a united Vietnam came into being.

Its combatants fought with cunning and deceit, a hidden conflict that nevertheless would steer the course of history. The story of the spies and intelligence-gatherers of the Roundheads and Royalists is one that sheds new light on the birth of the Commonwealth. In To Walk in the Dark, intelligence specialist John Ellis presents the first comprehensive analysis of the First English Civil War intelligence services. He details the methods of the Roundhead spies who provided their army commanders with a constant flow of information about the movements of the King's armies, describes the earliest use of code-breaking and mail interception and shows how the Cavalier intelligence forces were overcome. He also reveals the intelligence personnel themselves: the shadowy spymasters, agents, and femme fatales. The descriptions of how intelligence information was used in the main Civil War battles are particularly fascinating and show-for the first time-how intelligence information played a decisive role in determining the outcome of the Civil War itself. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71683","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71683&isn=9780750980098&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71683&isn=9780750980098&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71683&isn=9780750980098&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750980098","title":"Battle of Quatre Bras 1815","author":"Robinson, Mike.","subject":["HISTORY Military General","Military history"],"topic":["Military history.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"Founded on a wealth of primary source material, this is a unique account of a largely forgotten but highly significant conflict that resulted in Napoleon failing in his strategic objective of separating and defeating the Allied armies.

On September 13, 1759, British and French forces fought one of the most decisive battles of history, on the Plains of Abraham outside the Canadian capital of Quebec. The British force decisively routed the French, seized the city and ultimately all of Canada. Both the French and British commanders fell in the battle, and ever since the pathos and heroism of the encounter have engrossed historians. The struggle for Quebec was far more than one climactic battle. The campaign involved an immense military and naval operation, an 18th-century D-Day, which had begun the year before. Matthew Ward has researched extensively in archives in Britain and Canada to look at the entire campaign for Quebec, from its inception in Whitehall to its ultimate culmination in Montreal in 1760. He has probed beyond the actions of commanders and generals, to examine the experiences of the campaign for the ordinary soldier and civilian. What emerges is not just a picture of bravery and heroism, but also of a campaign which became increasingly brutal and cruel, both sides resorting to practices such as the routine scalping of enemy dead. It is also a surprising picture of the day-to-day, often mundane, lives of civilians and troops many thousands of miles from home. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498512","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71687","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71687&isn=9780750980135&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71687&isn=9780750980135&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71687&isn=9780750980135&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750980135","title":"Greenie","author":"Moore, Patrick A.","subject":["TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING History","TRANSPORTATION Ships Shipbuilding General","Technology","Technology -- History","Ships","Shipbuilding"],"topic":["Shipbuilding.","Ships.","Technology History.","TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING \/ History","TRANSPORTATION \/ Ships & Shipbuilding \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"In the RN vernacular, the term \"greenie\" describes the officers and ratings responsible for the electrical engineering functions of the fleet.

To what extent, for example, were Churchill and the successive Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff responsible for abandoning this outpost, which could not be reinforced when attacked or defended adequately? Is it true that fine leadership prolonged the fighting, inflicting serious casualties on the highly experienced Japanese when they struck in 1941? How useful was Britain's spying organization in China, which led to catastrophic repercussions for the POWs and Internees? What form did the Japanese atrocities take upon the helpless captives?This detailed and authoritative account of the campaign will provide a particularly compelling read for those interested in the Second World War or the history of the Far East. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498513","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71691","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71691&isn=9780750980562&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71691&isn=9780750980562&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71691&isn=9780750980562&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750980562","title":"Britain's Forgotten Wars","author":"Hernon, Ian.","subject":["HISTORY Military Other","Military history","History Modern","HISTORY Modern 19th Century"],"topic":["History, Modern","Military history.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ Other","HISTORY \/ Modern \/ 19th Century"],"genre":[],"description":"This is a collection of Ian Hernon's three books, Massacre and Retribution, The Savage Empire, and Blood in the Sand. Much has been written about the great British military triumphs of the 19th century, but there are many more astonishing stories which have been largely forgotten. These forgotten wars cannot hope to compete in history with the Crimean War or the Boer War, but for acts of sheer courage and endurance, they deserve to be remembered. Using the actual words of the soldiers themselves, Ian Hernon presents an account which evokes Victorian colonial warfare in all its barbarity and the self-righteous belief of the British in the rectitude of their cause. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498513","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71692","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71692&isn=9780750980579&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71692&isn=9780750980579&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71692&isn=9780750980579&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750980579","title":"Dogfight","author":"Price, Alfred.","subject":["HISTORY Europe General","Aeronautics Military","HISTORY Military Aviation","Aeronautics Military -- History"],"topic":["Aeronautics, Military History.","HISTORY \/ Europe \/ General","HISTORY \/ Military \/ Aviation"],"genre":[],"description":"From World War I, where we get a rare insight into the fighter operations over the fields of France, to the incredible Battle of Britain aeronautics, when the bravery of RAF fighter pilots saw off the might of the Luftwaffe, this exciting history places the reader in the cockpit during some of the greatest air battles of modern warfare. The horrifying loss of life inflicted on the Soviet Union by Hitler's Blitzkrieg offensive is explored here-more than 300 aircraft fell in air-to-air combat in one day. The daring exploits of the U.S. Eighth Air Force in their March 6, 1944 attack on Berlin highlights the power of fighter planes when supported by bomber crews. The jet age is heralded in by accounts of the air force's role in the Vietnam War and the Falklands. The role of reconnaissance aircraft in modern warfare is described alongside the precision of attacking pinpoint targets during the Gulf War in Iraq. This book not only uncovers how the tactics of aerial warfare have changed through each major modern conflict, but also allows the reader to feel like they were there in the skies, alongside these incredible pilots. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498513","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71693","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71693&isn=9780750980586&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71693&isn=9780750980586&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71693&isn=9780750980586&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750980586","title":"Third Reich 1919-1939","author":"Rawson, Andrew.","subject":["HISTORY Military World War II","HISTORY Europe Germany","World War 1939 1945"],"topic":["World War, 1939-1945.","HISTORY \/ Europe \/ Germany","HISTORY \/ Military \/ World War II"],"genre":[],"description":"A comprehensive single volume handbook covers the Nazis rise to power in Germany, complete with photographs from Heinrich Hoffman, Hitler's personal photographer The rise of Hitler's Nazi Party is one of the defining aspects of the 20th century. The manner in which National Socialist ideologies took over life in Germany is difficult to comprehend more than 75 years later. This fully illustrated book is a single-volume encyclopedia on all aspects of this important period in modern history. It starts with a shattered postwar Germany and charts the violent political tactics used by the Nazis to seize political control in 1933. The subsequent consolidation of power and brutal suppression of opponents followed as they took over all areas of society, introducing a new festival calendar to celebrate their takeover. The various military, political, and youth organizations are considered, the Nazis warped methods for maintaining law and order, and their use of the press and propaganda to control the people and introduce their racial ideals. Chapters also cover art, culture, education, the economy, and the leaders themselves. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498513","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71694","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71694&isn=9780750980593&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71694&isn=9780750980593&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71694&isn=9780750980593&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750980593","title":"Battlefield Afghanistan","author":"Ryan, Mike.","subject":["HISTORY Military General","Military history"],"topic":["Military history.","HISTORY \/ Military \/ General"],"genre":[],"description":"Avoiding a standard discussion of the politics behind the conflict, this thoroughgoing account of the war in the former Taliban state powerfully depicts the actual situation for those on the ground. Based on interviews from the front line in Afghanistan, this examination reveals how coalition forces are not simply keeping the peace but are currently involved in full-scale warfare with both al-Qaeda militants and the forces of the resurgent Taliban, fighting battles British forces have not experienced since Korea. Drawing from evidence provided by members of the 3rd Battalion, the 16th Air Assault Brigade, the Royal Marines, and the Special Forces community, this overview indicates that the hostilities these soldiers face have proven far greater than anticipated, and the situation in Afghanistan more serious than the politicians would like the public to realize. --Provided by publisher.","length":"","publisher":"The History Press,","dateSaved":"1504498513","availability":{"accessType":"acs","totalCopies":"1","availableCopies":1,"onHold":0}},{"id":"econtentRecord71695","image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71695&isn=9780750980609&size=medium&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","large_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71695&isn=9780750980609&size=large&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","small_image":"https:\/\/enkilibrary.org\/bookcover.php?id=71695&isn=9780750980609&size=small&upc=&category=EMedia&econtent=true","isbn":"9780750980609","title":"Rorke's Drift Men","author":"W.

This heroic stand became one of the most famous actions in the history of the British Army, and inspired the epic film Zulu! But who were these men who made such a stubborn resistance when all seemed lost, and what legacy have they left us?

Is there anything new to say about it in print? Yes there is, because most publications have concentrated on commanding officers Lucan, Cardigan, and the fatal actions of Nolan. But there were 670 men in the charge and by collating the evidence from the many eyewitnesses James Bancroft offers a new and more accurate appraisal of events. Cardigan's description of the action was quoted at length in the House of Commons: \". . . with the batteries vomiting forth upon us shells and shot, round and grape, with one battery on our right flank and another on the left . . . when we came to within a distance of fifty yards from the mouths of the artillery which had been hurling destruction upon us, we were, in fact, surrounded and encircled by a blaze of fire.\" One question of course-which the author, who has been studying the subject for many years, addresses-is how anyone survived.

The longest continuous military campaign of the Second World War, raging from 1939 to 1945, the Battle of the Atlantic saw the might of the Royal Navy pitted against the Kriegsmarine. The Germans' secret weapon was their fleet of U-boats-they had the largest fleet of submarines in the world, enabling them to play cat and mouse with the Allied forces to devastating effect. They would hunt in \"wolf-packs\" and would prey on merchant shipping and naval vessels. This startling book tells the story of this battle as viewed through the conning towers of these U-boats.
